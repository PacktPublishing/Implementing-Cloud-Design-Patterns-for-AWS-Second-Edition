## Get to Know the Author
**Sean Keery**
began hacking obscure video game systems at the age of 13. Sean then developed interpersonal skills while teaching snowboarding. Nowadays, Cloud Foundry, choreography, containers and plenty of .io. Cluster deployments, IaaS independence, and his studies for a master's in data science keep Sean occupied. The daily commute is filled with podcasts and chipmunk bunny hops. Some family time, spicy food, a good book, and wrecking the latest toys keep Sean busy at home.


**Clive Harber**
has been programming computers since he was 13, when Commodore Basic was all the rage and the internet, as an idea, was something that was only just starting to appear in films such as WarGames. Fast-forward a decade, he gained a master's degree in chemical engineering from University of Wales, Swansea, which he used briefly in a stint when he worked in a semi-conductor foundry making microchips. Not being totally satisfied with this, he decided to change fields and learn how to write stuff for the internet. Now, he runs his own consultancy, Distorted Thinking, providing services to organizations that find themselves in digital transition, whether that's software changes or infrastructure to cloud service migration.

**Marcus Young**
obtained a degree in computer science and mathematics before getting involved in system administration and DevOps. He currently works in software automation using open source tools and technologies. His hobbies include playing ice hockey and brewing homebrew beer. He also enjoys hardware projects based on microcontrollers and single-board computers.
